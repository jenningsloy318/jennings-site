For a long time, I am willing to setup a personal site to host my learning, reading and thoughts, but due to the operation overhead, I can't do this properly, perviously I tried to host it on my vps, but because of misconfiguration, the site is hacked and I lost all the data. I just pause the proposal, and continuously to find a better way that will not cost me too much time and energy.


Several months ago, I know astro, but it feels like a little complex; but today I try it again, and with ease I setup my blog and also host it in github pages, this save me a lot of effort.


I also enabled latex support,, so I can write the various equations in my blog; also mermaid is also added, with it I can draw some charts.


lets move on !!!
